# Demo Search UI 

Hello

I am glad to welcome you to check out the mock search UI I developed. 

This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 in Vite.


Technology Stack:
I utilized the Vite bundler to create a Vue 3 application. The unit tests were written using Vitest(Vite's testing ki) which seamlessly supports ES Modules.

Vue 3 and TypeScript Integration:
The project is built upon Vue 3 and TypeScript, utilizing the setup function provided by Vue 3. This combination did the magic in many components and also gave me some effective solutions

Modular Architecture:
A modular architecture approach has been followed throughout the project. This design decision ensures scalability, code organization, and ease of maintenance.

Styling and Aesthetic Appeal:
Tailwind CSS was employed for styling. The design incorporates the logo and color palette to enhance the overall aesthetic appeal, catering to responsiveness on medium and large screens.

State Management:
Vuex is utilized for state management, contributing to a structured and organized approach for handling the application state.

Chart Representation:
The Vue-chart.js package has been integrated to present overall statistics graphically.
